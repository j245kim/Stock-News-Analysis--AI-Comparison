# U.S. Stock Index Overview

This index, developed by the American credit rating company Standard & Poor's, represents a major U.S. stock market index.

Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ Composite Index, it is considered one of the key stock market indices in the U.S. Notably, it includes about 500 major companies that account for over 80% of the market capitalization of U.S. listed companies, making it the practical benchmark index.

Therefore, it can be considered a relatively safe asset. (However, don't blindly invest based on this)

**Note on News Analysis:**  
When evaluating news, it’s important to assess its credibility (chatbots generally can't do this as they take data up to 2024). 

Determining whether news is real or fake can be done using deep learning! A combination of deep learning and AI would be quite powerful.

For a real-world stock project, it’s essential to verify the credibility of news data and analyze public sentiment on the news (e.g., by crawling social media data).
